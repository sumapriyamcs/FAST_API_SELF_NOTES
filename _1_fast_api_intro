1.fastapi:

FastAPI framework, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with
Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

2.The key features are:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *

Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for
APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

3.installation:
pip install fastapi

You will also need an ASGI server, for production such as Uvicorn or Hypercorn.

pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

Create a file main.py with
run it on server
